# BookSearch-Engine

## Description
**BookSearch-Engine** is a MERN challenge, a full-stack application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Originally built as a RESTful API, it was later refactored into a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) powers this application, offering a robust and efficient way to search, save, and manage book information.
